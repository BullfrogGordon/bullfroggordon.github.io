              Chess Opening Trainer
            </h1>
            <h3>Want to impress your friends with your vast knowledge of chess openings and their strange and esoteric names? Try this naming quiz!</h3>
            <p>How it works: <br><br>
            A Flask API written in python grabs a database entry from a MongoDB instance. The entry includes the name of the opening along with the FEN, a chess position identifer. The name of the opening gets sent to the front-end. The user positions the board and submits. The FEN and name are sent to the API. The server compares the POST to the corresponding database entry and responds with whether or not they match. The board and pieces are from the open source chessboardjs written by Chris Oakman.

            </div>
            <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
            <p>• Add a 'show position' button that reveals the opening <br>
              • Implement a scoring system for consecutive correct answers</p>

              StoryRound- Collaborative Multiplayer Game
            </h1>
            <h3> This is a digital version of a game I used to play with students. Creative writing is fun! It's more fun to collaborate and write a story with friends. This game lets you write with a group of friends no matter where you all are!</h3>
            <p>
              How it works: <br><br>
              A .NET API written in C# stores a unique game PIN, the names of the game players, and the stories they are writing. Each player starts a story and then the story is sent to the server and given to another player to continue. This process is repeated until all of the rounds are over and the completed stories are presented to all of the players.

            <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
            <p>• Change polling function that causes timer discrepancy to a socket implementation <br>
              • Beautify the story return screen <br>
              • Add buffer time to allow users to read the previous story before allowing them to write.</p>
