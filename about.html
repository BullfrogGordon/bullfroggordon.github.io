            About Me:
        </h1>
        <h3>
            I spent the first ten years of my professional life teaching composition to high-ability middle school students. </br> In 2020, I spent a year as a technical writer before transitioning into product management. </br> <br> <span style="color:#277a00">Now, I just love to build.</span>
        </h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            I've worked with JavaScript, node, C#, .NET, Python, Flask, and various databases on my personal projects.
            My favorite language is whatever I'm learning that week, and my favorite project is the one I just finished. 
            In my free time I read about coding, study code, do coding puzzles, and build things with code. I also read about chess, study chess, do chess puzzles, and occasionally even play chess.
