        <h2><img class="icon" src="imgs/developer.svg"> A Developer -</h2>
        <p>I love to attack problems and build solutions! My favorite language is whichever I'm learning that week, and my favorite project is the one that I just finished. I love to collaborate and explore new technologies- send me a challenge or an idea! Please check out my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> to see some of my recent work where I've focused on building APIs.</p>
        <h3>Tools I've Used:</h3>
        <p> JavaScript, C# & .NET, Python & Flask, NoSQL, HTML, CSS</p>
        <h2><img class="icon" src="imgs/strategy.svg"> A Product Manager -</h2>
        <p>I've spent the last three years working in Product. I've worked in both the Cyber Security (PAM) and EdTech sectors focusing on data-driven roadmap building and bridging the gap between long-term strategy and short-term tactical thinking. </p>
        <h3>Expertise:</h3>
        <p>Strategic Development, Backlog Management, Customer Outreach and Engagement, User Story Creation, Persona Development, Agile & Scrum Methodologies</p>
        <h2><img class="icon" src="imgs/google-docs.svg"> A Writer -</h2>
        <p>My first role in cyber security was writing technical documentation for several products. One product was an API-heavy, CLI-only credential management tool. It was working on that product that I became interested in furthering my own technical education.</p>
        <h3>Documents I've Written:</h3>
        <p>Technical Publications, Copy & Content, Marketing, and even a novel or two.</p>
        <h2><img class="icon" src="imgs/apple.svg"> A Teacher -</h2>
        <p>I spent eleven years in the classroom, teaching every grade level 6-12. I spent the bulk of my time in the classroom teaching English Composition and Literature to high-ability 6th graders. I manage time and stress well.</p>
        <h3>Subjects I've Taught:</h3>
        <p> English Literature, English Composition, Reading, Drama, History, English as a Learned Language</p>
